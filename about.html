    <p> Welcome on my portfolio website. I coded this website all by myself because this is one of the new things I have learned during this period. Since I do not have to travel every day to Leeuwarden and I cannot do some other things I used to do I have some spare time left. I think this is a great period for change and development. There are a view things I particularly focused on the past months such as coding, learning Spanish and personal development. I want to grow and I have been really motivated to learn new things. Although I think I was more productive in the first weeks of the crisis than now, because this module I am quite busy with school. But one of my goals for this module was that I wanted to spend more time on coding again, because it would be a loss if I would quit doing it after only one week of following classes. But then I found it hard to have time to spend on coding, because school is always my first priority. So, at that moment I was thinking about combining my coding skills with something for school and I think that the portfolio is a great opportunity to work on my coding skills and show one of my talents. The last thing was also a syllabus assignment for this module. I am still a beginner with coding, so this website will probably not be perfect, but I do put a lot of effort into it.

    <p> A lot of things has changed during the past few months. But to be honest I did not encounter any problems so far and I do not find it hard to adapt to this situation. I think it is nice that I can almost schedule my own days, that I can work a lot, earn some money and I can also work on things I want to learn. On the other hand, I think it is very pity that I do not see my friends now and also when working on a project I think it is nicer if you can also meet up in person. This period let me thought of the idea of studying for a while abroad. Things will probably stay for a while like this and when we are allowed to travel again I would love to continue my study abroad. I can already imagine myself studying abroad for about two months. At this moment travelling is not possible, what I really do understand and I also chose to cancel my own trip in July to Indonesia. I have been really looking forward to this backpack trip, but due this circumstances I did not feel like this is the moment to go there. I feel also sad for the people living in Indonesia, because they are really depending on touristing activities, but I think my health is more important. Hopefully continuing my study for a while abroad would be a possibility when travelling is possible again.
My days feel like the days when I was in Thailand. It felt a kind of freedom, because I could decide how my days should look like, learn new things and new people. I felt more relaxed and my mind got some more rest. I am glad that I feel like this, but if I think about it, it sounds maybe a bit weird, because these days we actually do not have freedom. We have to create our own freedom of what is possible within the boundaries set by the governments.
