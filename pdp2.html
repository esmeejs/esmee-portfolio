  <p> This year have been a great learning experience for me. I only got aware of the fact that this is already the last month last week.
    Time is going so fast and this month I have to spend a lot of my time on school things. I am still happy with my choice to study IB,
    although I am not sure if this is something I want to do in the future, I really like the study program. The program covers a lot of aspects
    within culture and business. I think I liked the marketing module the most because we could make our own campaign from scratch.
    During the first project we got the chance to work for a real company. I think this is the best way to learn theory. In addition the project of module 3 was also very interesting.
    We had to do a lot of research and this is something I do not mind to do. I put a lot of effort in the projects and it helped improving my research skills. </p>

    <p> if I look back to the september I think I have really changed as a person. My perspective on several things have changed. This study
      have made me really aware of the fact that I want to live abroad and discover the beautiful things this world has to offer. My language skills have improved
      and I met so many new and inspiring people. I have also become more flexible during the year, what was one of my goals for the Global Mind Monitor.
      I just read back some of my learning journals from the first month and it was funny to read them. My use of language has definitely improved, but also the way I thought about things.
      I wrote done so many things, almost every detail of that certain day. I am also happy about the fact that I decided to study in Leeuwarden.
      It turned out so different than I thought it would be. Leeuwarden is an international city and it is a nice place to study international business.
      I am glad that I have got the opportunity this year to travel, learn and meet new people. I did something I would never have done one year ago.
      I gave presentations about IB and helped during the open day. It was nice to inform people about something I like and also getting to know new people.
      I can't believe how fast this year went. It has been an amazing year and I am really curious about how the second year will be. Only one more year before I can study or do my internship abroad.</p>

<div class= "col-6">
  <p> Smart goal 1: I want to learn another new language by first using Duolingo and after a while following a real course.
    I want to decide on which language before the first school day and I want practise at least every day for thirty minutes:
    I set this goal for myself because Taiye Selasi made me realise how important it is to communicate with people.  I am not really sure
    yet which new language I want to start learning, because there are a lot of languages I still want to learn. I would like to learn Italian,
    France, Portguese, Bahasa Indonesia and Mandarin. Since this year I am learning Spanish, but in September it is time to learn an additional language. </p>

    <p> Smart goal 2: I want to expand my cultural knowlegde and get out of my comfortzone by studying abroad for at least 6 weeks.
      I would like to do this in November 2020, if we are allowed to travel again and if can arrange it with school: If you do not know already, I love to travel and discover new places.
      I am my best self when travelling or spending time abroad. I had planned another backpack trip for this summer but due the Covid-19 we decided to cancel it. Instead of travelling I will be working this whole summer.
      I think it really is a pity that we cannot go to Indonesia, but I think our health is more important. However, I think it would be great if I can travel to Asia in November and continue my study over there.
      This period has learned us that there are many possibilities regarding to online education. So, I think that it is possible that I can continue my study for two months or so in Asia.
      I think it also fits our study program: international business. The words of Taiye Selasi inspired me even more to make this idea an actual plan.
      This is what she said during Being International Day: 'Chose the job that is the furthest of your comfort zone - take the place that is far away in someway, you can always come back.'
      I know that studying is not the same as a job, but I think these words are also relevant to study and living abroad. Let's hope that I will be possible, fingers crossed. </p>

    <p> Smart goal 3: I want to do an activity besides just the general study program. I want to do this by joining an organisation within school within the next five months.
      I want to do this because I think it is a great way to learn new skills, expand my knowlegde and meet new people: The first year is almost over and even though I thought it has been a very interesting year, it was not very difficult.
      I want to challenge myself and doing something new. I have never joined an organisation within an university, so this would be the first time. I already set the first step, I applied for the vacacy of assistant planner for the I-Staff team.
      As an assistant planner I have to organise ISA's and make itineraries for upcoming trips. Due to the corona virus it will be a bit different know, but I think this vacacy is made for me.
      I love to organise and plan jobs and I have a great eye for detail when it comes to planning trips. I am always looking for hidden gems and I can spend hours on doing so. I am not sure yet I if I will be chosen, but I think that I made a good impression during the interview.
      Let's see what year 2 will bring. </p>

      <p> So these are all my goals for the second year. I really hope that I can continue my study for a while abroad next school year. This will also be very helpful for learning a new language.
        I am very motivated to finish this year with 60 out of 60 points and I will also give 200% during the second year of IB. I hope it will be such a great year as this year has been so far and that I can expand my knowlegde, meeting new people and make the best of it. </p>
