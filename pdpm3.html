  <p> For the writing of my portfolio in module 3 I also had to write a personal development plan for this module. These are the goals I have set for myself for module 4:
    </p>
<p> <UL STYLE="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0em;">
    <LI> Improve my English skills by reading another English book besides the finance book. I also want to practice with making gap assignments to feel more confident when making the EBC exams. </LI>
    <LI> I want to express myself better to prevent anger during projects. I want to do this by having a strict code of conduct and talk about what we can expect from each other before the project. We did this during our second meeting, when we all were there. </LI>
    <LI> I want to relax more often. I think since this ‘crisis’ I already feel more relaxed. Things still are complicated, but I can almost schedule all the days myself now, which I think is really nice. </LI>
    </UL> </p> 

    <p> The rounding of of module 3, was different than the other’s and a bit chaotic. The final DBE presentations were totally fine. I was even surprised that we got a 9.0 on our final report. I was really satisfied about the report, but I did not expect to get a 9.0, what is really nice. We were supposed to have a supply chain exam, but it got cancelled, which is sad because I learned two whole days when the weather was really nice and I spent the whole day inside. That is sad, but it can not be changed. Now I do not even know when the exam will take place, I think it is kind of annoying not knowing when the exam will be and already having another module started, but it do not frustrate me anymore. I will just wait and keep go on. It will be a waste of time to be frustrated about something no one knows. I learned from the rounding of of module three that this can be perfectly done online as well. I hope this will cause a shift and that we will get more classes online after this whole situation. I was planning to go to Indonesia this summer for six weeks, but I do not think it will happen, which is very sad. So, I was thinking that if it is possible and if we can travel again to go by the end of this year and follow my classes online. It is possible now, so why not when this whole situation is over. Besides that I am also doing an international study program so that is another reason for me to follow my classes abroad. </p>
