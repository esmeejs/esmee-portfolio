    <p> It’s quite hard to think about my own talents and my strengths. I know there are some things I am good at, but not like singing or a particular sport.
      So, if I have to think about what makes me unique in a positive way this is what popped up at my mind: </p>

      <p> I am very organised and I also like to organise things. This is not particularly something that makes me unique since I definitely are not the only person who is organised and like to organise things. But still I think this is something that makes me unique in a positive way. I am still very young and if I look back at the things I have already done, I think that is something that makes me unique. I have always liked it to organise trips with my family or to do things by myself. Some examples: I was fourteen when I went by myself to the Amsterdam Fashion Week and I even went backstage at some of the shows. I know that at that moment it did not even feel very special or unique, but if I look back at it I think this is something unique and although people always told me this I was too stubborn at that age. But I now am aware that it is quite unique that a thirteen / fourteen years old travel by herself to Amsterdam and go by herself to a fashion week. I can easily connect with people and impress them. I arranged it all by myself to get invited to the fashion week and even go backstage. This is something I am very proud of when I look back.
Another example is my trip to Ibiza: I was fourteen years old and it was not my dad deciding on the things we would do there, but it was me talking to the travel agent all the time. I know what I wanted to see and to do and I spent a lot of time on doing research to our destinations. I even made a program for the whole week with things we could do, places we could go, restaurants we could eat and I was even already busy with the styling of the document. This is something I still do. I always turn things around, I think things looks better with some appropriate styling, to make it unique. I always do this school related and not school related. </p>

<p> I think this made me who I am today. I still love to travel and organise this all by myself. Maybe this is something I want to use in the future, especially in combination with travelling. I look for all the details and everything to make sure I will not miss anything special or nice, but on the other hand I like surprises as well and I do not schedule everything, but I just want to know what a place has to offer and what the opportunities are. I think by travelling already a lot at a age of 18 years old I also do have more experience than the average kid of 18 years old. Travelling really gives you another view of the world and let you look different on certain things, like culture and people. Travelling also helps me to learn more about myself and discover what I do like and what I do not like.
Something I like to do as well is writing. When I am travelling I always try to write down as many details and I always keep a journal. So I can keep my friends and family updated but it is also nice for me to read this back later and it will reminds me of things I probably would forget otherwise. I used to had my own blog and I wrote all kind of things on it. Writing also helps me to express my feelings better and to literally write away my anger. </p>

<p> I think my strengths relate to the learning outcomes of IB. I think by travelling and writing down so many things I am very aware of my own personal development. I don’t mind to write about my own personal development or to reflect my own strengths and weaknesses because it helps me to be even more aware of my own development. I am very open minded and like to meet new people and since I have travelled to some countries already I have some experiences with different cultures and how it is to be in a new and another culture. I really like to meet new people from all the world, this is also why one of biggest passions is travelling. For me personally, Morocco was a new culture and country for me. It was also the first time for me visiting a North-Africa country. It was a really nice experience, the people were really nice and I loved to learn about this (business) culture and write later on about it. </p>

<p> If I would have a job interview I think this strengths would help me. I am very open minded and I already have gained experience with working in multi cultural teams and being in other environments and I think this will be even more important in the future. Also, organising could be very useful. I think I could be a leader, but I do not know if this is what I want to be. Although I am very organised, and good at communicating. Communication is key and I always try to communicate everything so everyone knows what’s going on. </p>

<p> This website obviously also shows one of my more upcoming talents: coding. This is something I started with during the Covid crisis because I wanted to learn new things.
  It takes a lot of time to learn it, but I do really like it. I consider this portfolio as my first real project. Since I have been very busy with school the past few weeks I did not have that much time for coding, so I looked for a solution.
  I decided to combine coding with something for school. It takes some more time than making another report in Pages or Keynote, but I learn a lot of new things while makinhg this portfolio. </p>
