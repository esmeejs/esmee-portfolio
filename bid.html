    <p> This week we had the Being International Day. This was my first edition and I did not really know what to expect from it. It was the first online edition.
      There were about eleven speakers and I signed up for three workshops: Q&A with Taiye Selasi, workshop with The Happy Financial, and the workshop with Ricardo Arcega Adrados.
      The day begun with two speeches from Taiye Selasi and Alina Andreasen. The speech from Alina Andreasen was about change management. I think her speech was very interesting and she involved us by asking questions during the presentation.
      Alina said during her presentation that she is really glad that she works with a lot of different cultures and that she can meet other people because of International Business.
      I think the cultural part about our study program is very interesting and I love to learn about new cultures. So, I hope that I will have this opportunity later as well. Some of the questions Alina asked during her presentation were:

      <UL STYLE="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0em;">
      <LI> When have you experienced productivity loss or disruption? </LI>
      <LI> What is your motto? </LI>
      <LI> Have you ever been part of a high performance team before? </LI>
      </UL> </p>

      <p> During the past months I have been very productive, but there were also some moment that I really loss this productivity.
        I really pressure myself to be productive, but sometimes it is just gone. In the begin of the Covid times I think I was most productive. I had a really good routine and I spent a lot of time on learning new things, such as coding and photography.
        I also ran every morning together with my boyfriend and, read books and spent time on learning Spanish. After a while, when things changed a bit and people started to live their social life again I lost my productivity.
        At least, I think that is the point where I lost my productivity. Also, I followed a seven day course for coding, so I was very motivated to do learn everyday. When the challenge was over I did not really know what to do next.
        The challenge was perfect and it gave me a kind of routine to do it everyday and it also told me what to do. So, when the course ended I just simply did not know how I could develop myself further.
        I was really waiting for another challenge or course instead of doing things myself. I think this is another reason why I was less productive after a while.
        My boyfriend was spending the weekends with his friends again instead of me with me, so we also quit running then. We always did it in the early morning and then we just quit doing so.
        We both wanted to start again, but we did not. My productivity for school has been the same, it did not changed. I just kept on doing the things I had to do and studied. But, I do not
        want my life only to be about school. I wanted to learn new things and live a healthy life again. I think that I am productive again, but not yet on the same level as I was two months ago.
        I started another course, because that keeps me very motivated and I started running again. I feel so good after a run and thinking about that feeling keeps me motivated to run. </p>

        <p> I have not really thought about a motto in my life. But there are a few things that are really important for me.
          I really want to live a happy life and not do things I do not want to do. I have a lot of dreams and all of them are outside the Netherlands.
          I really have a strong will of living abroad and start a life over there. But I realise that I also find it important to have a kind of plan, or at least knowing what I want to do when I move to a new country.
          I want to have a goal. These are things I am thinking about, but I would also like it to just go somewhere without a plan. I want to make the best of my life, and I just not see this happening here in Meppel.
          So, I think my motto is that I want to live life to the fullest. </p>

          <p> I think that I have quite a lot experience of working in project teams already. I did three years of VWO+ and this means that in addition to normal VWO we had four projects a year.
            During this projects I had to work in teams and I liked it. I like to observe people when working in groups and see how they are working. I have worked in teams which were not productive at all, but I also was part of very productive teams.
            I think the most productive and high performance group I have been part of is the DBE group of this module.
            We are working very efficient because of good communication and everyone being very motivated. I think that being surrounded by motivated people really helps performing well.
            I perform better with people around me who are really motivated because then you keep each other motivated as well and it is really dynamic.

<p> I think the speech of Alina was interesting, but Taiye Selasi her speech impressed me the most. I really liked her view on things.
  Selasi her speech was about identity. I have never really thought about my identity and just always told people that I am from the Netherlands.
  Selasi tells people that she is a local in certain place instead of saying that she is from one particular country. I think this is very interesting and it let me think about it as well.
  I could consider myself as a local in Meppel, but also a local in Thailand. Although, I do not think that I have been long enough in Thailand to consider myself as a local, but I do understand what Selasi is meaning.
  She really inspired me even more to live abroad and to make the best of life. She told us that when she moves to a new city she just walks through the city without her phone and just look and see what is around her.
  This is another thing I never really thought of but I think it is the best way to explore a new place. You will not be distracted by your phone and you can just admire the things around you.
  I think it is also easier to connect with other people, because if you do not know something you cannot just look it up on the internet. If you want to know an answer on your question you have to ask the people around you. </p>

<p>  I was just really impressed by her speech and she really have given me more motivation to just go and do it.
  I signed up for the Q&A with Selasi, because I expected already that I would find her story interesting. I had never heard of her before,
  but I did some research and so I decided that I wanted to join the Q&A. I asked her this question: How was it for you to adapt to the countries you have lived in?.
  Her answer was that you should look and see things with curiousity and not by comparing. So for example, when she moved to Portugal with her man, he was comparing things in Portugal with how things will go in Germany.
  This is also something I learned new. I never really compare things with each other, only when I am back in the Netherlands. When I was in Thailand I did not compare the things to how it would be in the Netherlands, but when I was back at home I did the other way around.
  I was comparing things that happened in Thailand to how it would be in the Netherlands. For example freedom. I really felt that I had a lot of freedom when travelling Thailand, but I lost this feeling when I was back at home.
  So, then I would say that I miss the freedom I had in Thailand and the good food and other great things. During my next travel I will look to things with more curiousity.
  I think I already did this, but I was not really aware of doing so. </p>

<p> I will never forget these words by Taiye Selasi: 'Chose the job that is the furthest of your comfort zone - take the place that is far away in someway, you can always come back.'
  I think she is absolutely true. Although I have a really strong will of moving to another country and I know already that I want to do this, it is still something new and outside my comfortzone.
  I just want to do it and see what life will bring me and otherwise I can just go back. </p>
</p>

<p> I think especially because of the speech of Taiye Selasi and the Q&A I found the other two workshops less interesting. The Q&A run out of time so I entered the workshop room of The Happy Financial later.
  I think I missed some important information in the beginning, because I could not really understand where she was telling about. So for the next Being International Day I have to leave the other room earlier so I will be on time and do not miss important information or the organisation should add some more extra time to prevent this.
  Since I could not really follow her story and what she was talking about I also found it less interesting. The other workshop was given by Ricardo Arcega Adrados. He is working for Speakap.
  I had never heard of this company before this workshop, but it sounded interesting. Especially in times of corona communication is very important. Ricardo told us about that we should make the physical distance, virtually disappear.
  I agree to this and I it is interesting. There are a lot of online options to make the physical distance disappear. Of course, I know that it is not the same as meeting up in real life. But, we just have no other option and it is always better to think in solutions than in problems.
  That is why I think it also very good that the I-Staff and IBCO organised an online Being International Day instead of just doing nothing. The internet gives us many new options and I believe that this is the future.
  An online Being International Day gives us the chance to meet people from all over the world. Interesting people from all over the world could have been invited for this event, because it is easy to access. People do not have to come all the way to Leeuwarden to give a speech and to go back home.
  I believe that the internet gives us new opportunities and that it can be seen as a solution rather than a problem. Some things could have been better, such as giving only access to manage the presentation to the spoke person to prevent other people scrolling through the presentation.
  But, it is only the first online edition so these are only things that can be improved during next years editions. Overall, I think it was a very interesting day and particulary because of Taiye Selasi. Her speech really impressed me and inspired me. It would be great to see her or another
  inspiring person at the (online) Being International Day next year. </p>
