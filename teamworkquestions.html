    <!-- add why came up with this name -->
<p> We are team MESA. This name includes our initials and comes from the Latin meaning 'around the table'. For us this name means that we as a team are all sitting around the same table and that we are all responsible for the task.
   In the first week we talked together about the questions mentioned in the syllabus.
  I am very glad that I am a part of this team. We are all very motivated and willing to do the things we have to do.
  We are four serious people, but we are also having fun during our online meetings. It feels a kind of weird that we are only working online
  and that we are not meeting up in real life to talk about the project. We are maybe planning to do this soon. I think it would be very nice to see
  each other again and to work on this project together in real life. Things are working out great so far and I think we all know what we can expect from each other.
  I think it is good to know what we can expect from each other, so we started by telling each other about our strenghts.

  <UL STYLE="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0em;">
<LI> Spencer: Organised and is good at doing things on his own and working togetger. </LI>
<LI> Mark: Hard worker and is taking deadlines very seriously. </LI>
<LI> Alisa: Organised and very motivated to do the tasks. </LI>
<LI> Madara: Can be considered as the completer. Madara is a perfectionist and what everything to look great for delivery. </LI>
</UL> </p>

<p> My own strenghts are that I am being a good communicator and very motivated and willing to get out the best of something.
  For me personally it really helps when everyone is motivated, because then you motivate each other as well.
  Another thing what I like about this group is that we are really all on the same level and there is not really a leader.
  Maybe the other's see my as a kind of leader, because that is what they told me in the feedback I received, but they think I am a fair leader.
  For me it is very important that everyone can give their own opinion. I do not really see myself as a leader in this group, more as a representative who informs the project managers.
   </p>

<p class="geenruimte"> These are the questions I answered first individually and then discussed within our team during the first week: </p>
<p> <ol STYLE="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0em;">
<li> <p class="pzwart"> What do you expect from M4? </p> I expect M4 to be the most difficult module of this year. I think it is more difficult than the others because we will have a lot of exams this module and I also think that especially finance is very hard. I have some experience with M&O, but I know for sure that I need to practice a lot with the assignments in the book and online. </li>
<li> <p class="pzwart"> Did you attend the introduction lecture/kick off for M4? What did you learn from it? </p>  Yes I attend the introduction. Eelco gave us some tips about where we can find information about companies. Besides this information the kick-off was mostly about general information of this module.  </li>
<li> <p class="pzwart"> What is most important for you when working in a team? </p> I think the most important for me when working in a team is that everyone is motivated and willing to participate in the project. </li>
<li> <p class="pzwart"> What do you have to offer your team in M4? (think about your strengths; what tops did
you get from your team members in previous modules?) </p> I think I can add to this team an organised structure, leading and a participant. By being a participant I mean that when I am in the team I will be there for real and I will do the things I have to do. I am also a perfectionist, so I will probably bring that to the team as well, although I am trying to be more flexible and also see what the others can add.  </li>
</ol> </p>

<p> After the discussion of these questions we conducted a code of conduct together based on our norms and values. I think a code of conduct is very important because you never know what will happen in the end. But so far,
  our teamwork is going great and I am really happy that I can be a part of this very motivated team. </p>

  <p> While I have been reading through my learning journals I saw that I have had to answer questions about online working with my team in week 3. So these are the questions about working online with my team found in the syllabus of week 3: </p>

  <p> <ol STYLE="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0em;">
  <li> <p class="pzwart"> Now that you have to work online with your team, what are the differences with working ‘offline’?
</p> I think working only in an online environment is very different than working online. On the other hand, things are quite the same as before. It feels like I know the people where I working with, but not very well. I feel there really is a distance and if you want to work on something together I think it’s easier to do that offline, but so far it works out pretty well online. I think it is very much depending on if everyone is motivated or not. Because in real life it is easier to tell people what to do and to motivate people than in the online environment. I can imagine that some people feel a bit lost. I haven’t noticed this yet in our team. We are all hard working on the project. </li>
  <li> <p class="pzwart"> What is the biggest challenge for you in working exclusively online with your team? </p>   I do not really think it’s a challenge, I think it’s the future. So far in our group things are working out very well, so I did not really experienced it as a challenge. The only thing I ‘miss’ is seeing each other in real life and working on the project together in an offline environment. I think expressing creativity is still a challenge in the online environment.   </li>
  <li> <p class="pzwart"> Are there any advantages and if yes, which?  </p> Yeah I think for sure that working online has advantages as well. We have more flexibility right now when we have to decide when to meet up. I think I am way more productive than before. Another advantage is that we connect even though we are not at the same place, so I think it will bring also new opportunities for the future. </li>
  <li> <p class="pzwart"> What does your team now need to make sure you successfully finish this module?
</p> I think the most important thing is that everyone keeps being motivated, so we have to motivate each other. Since we do not see each other at school I think it’s easier to come up with excuses, so as long everyone is motivated to bring this project to a good end we will be fine. We are communicating well and we are meeting around 2-3 times a week to make sure that we finish everything on time, so we won’t have stress in the end.

  </ol> </p>
