  <h1 class="justheaders"> Learning Journal Week 1 </h1>
  <p> This week is the first week of module four. I am kind of exited for this module. It will be the first module totally given online and I think it will be the hardest module as well.
    I am not afraid, but I am curious. Finance probably will be a challenge, although I do believe that if I study and practice a lot I can handle it. We will see, at least I will give it my best try. </p>

    <p> Today, Monday, we had the kick-off of the module, which I think was pretty well organised. At this moment I still do not really understand what we have to deliver in the end of DBE, but I know from previous projects (when I had this as well) that it become more clear when working on it. So, I will just wait patiently and use all the knowledge I have right now to work on the project. Since the lockdown I have been very motivated to do things, not mainly school things, but other interesting things. I want to develop myself in other ways besides the general school system. I am working less than I used to do before, because I want to spend more time on for example coding or learning Spanish and I also have to combine this with school. I will have more exams this module than I ever have had before this year, so I start right away. At least that is what I do now, hopefully I can stick to this mindset the whole module. </p>

    <p> This module I will be working on the DBE project with Mark, Spencer, Alisa and Madara. I think it is quite an exciting team. For me it sounds like a good team, with people who take school things seriously. From previous modules I learned that I should not expect too much from other people because that can cause disappointments. So, although I do like the team and the people who are in it, I will just see what it brings and how everything will work out. What I like about being in this team is that I am working with people I have never worked before, except for Mark. Another thing I like is that there are three internationals in our team. It could become a challenge, but I am totally up for new challenges. Besides that, I actually never talked to Alisa, so a few days earlier (before I knew that I would be with her in a group) I sent her a message on Instagram and asked her how she is doing. I like to meet new people and it was actually kind of weird I think that I have never talked to her at school while we are in the same class. </p>

    <p> On Wednesday and Thursday we had meetings for DBE. The meeting on Monday was without Spencer, so that is why we scheduled another one to talk about our expectations and our roles. We all said that we are very organised and hard workers, so I am very curious about this new project. I already noticed that Spencer indeed is very organized and leading everything, not in a bad way. For the first time I do not write the logbook and to be honest I do not really mind about it. I like to write, but this time I could spend time on other tasks instead of being responsible for writing a logbook every week. So, this week we have had three meetings and I think they were all very productive. We did mainly talk about the project and looked for company’s during the meeting together. We worked on the code of conduct, the research plan and a project plan. I decided to just see how this project goes. This is my first project this year where I will be a little bit more on the background, instead of being a leader and organising everything myself. It will be another learning experience, but I am open to it. </p>

    <p> This week we only had two days of class, so besides school I worked two days and I spend some more time with friends (digitally). I started investing time in some new skills, such as coding and learning Spanish. I already do learn Spanish at school, but that is only once a week and more business related. It’s too bad that we cannot travel, because I was supposed to go to Ibiza within a month and I thought that I could practice my Spanish there in real life.  Unfortunately, it is what it is and I have to deal with these circumstances. I do not really mind not going to school at this moment, but I miss to have social life and see people and talk about things. I have called with some friends, which actually was really nice, but it is still different than doing the things together. I also spend an evening with one of my friends. I know her since I was five or so, and we used to go to the same elementary school and then to the same high school, but after high school we both went another ‘direction’. I am happy that I am still seeing her sometimes, although we have both very different interests right now. Let’s hope this situation will be over very soon. I cannot wait to travel the world again. </p>

      <p> So, May break is over again. It is always nice to have a week of holidays after the first or second week of the new module. This last module will go so quick, especially because of all the days off. During the break I toke some rest, worked a bit and did some stuff for school. So far, I am up-to-date with finance, what gives me a satisfied feeling. It takes some more time than I expected, especially because I am also summarising the book. Making the exercises is already a learning experience for me; there is a lot of repetition in the assignments. It remembers me of when I was at high school and I had to learn new words for French or German and using WRTS to practice. I wanted to do more for Spanish during the break, but I did not have enough time. I could have made time, but I think it is also good to have some days off and no screen time. So, that is what I did.
</p>

<p> We decided to have a meeting for DBE during the break, because we still needed to find the companies. I think this is something we all have underestimated, or at least I did. I thought that it would be easier to find companies, who share their financial information and do not have more revenue than about 150 million euros annually. I think I have watched over 100 different skincare companies, without success. I heard from a friend of mine from another class that she did not even know that we have to look for companies that are small or medium sized. Actually, some people from our own class chose company’s that obviously have a higher revenue than 100 million euros annually. They also did not know anything about company’s from different countries and the size of the company. So, maybe we were too hard for ourselves, and we were just looking at the wrong companies. I also did look for other sectors, because I spent two of my days looking for skincare company’s without success, which is kind of demotivating. Especially Dutch company’s were hard to find. So, we had another meeting talked about it and looked for a solution. I asked my father, who is an investor, so he knew some websites where we could find company’s based on market capacity sizes. </p>

<p> My dad shared his ‘simply wallst’ account with me. That really helped me and therefore the rest of our team. I got access to all trading company’s and it gave me access to all their financial information as well. We mostly used it to at least find company’s in the skin care branch and it became quite easy with the account. During the meeting we had scheduled on the next day we discussed all the skincare company’s I found on the website and we looked for their financial information. What I really learned during this past year is to think in solutions and challenge myself instead of thinking in problems. Even though it was discouraging not finding the right company’s after looking for two days we decided to look for other solutions instead for seeing at as a problem. I think this is something really important. </p>

<p> I do not have so many school days this module and I do not really mind about it. I feel very comfortable in this situation and to be honest I hope that some things will change after this period. It gives me so much flexibility and time to think about other things as well. I mean, I have more time to work but besides that I also have time now to spend on personal developing. I think I only realise now how chill it would have been if I would live in Leeuwarden and it would safe me so much time. Not just that, I can basically decide on my own schedule now and I can do the things when I want to do it. This period gives me a lot of rest. </p>

<p> I can also understand why people come up with the best new start-up ideas during times like this. Although I gave myself a lot of days off, I now wished that I had more days off because I think there will not be many more periods like this in my life, or to say it differently, I hope there will be more periods like this in my life where I can learn new things and develop myself within a healthy environment. Back in the days, when I was at Bali with my father, we talked about how great it would be to live and work there. I hope one day in my life to move to a tropical place and build a new life over there. I also am aware of the fact that I can decide on this all by myself, just like spending more time on things I really like to do and want to do. But, since I know I probably will move abroad within a few years I rather save some more money now and combine that with as many new things and skills to learn. </p>

    <h1 class="justheaders"> Learning Journal Week 3 </h1>

    <p> This week was bit differently than the others. I already felt for a longer time that there was something going on but I was not really sure what and I did not feel that I had to ask it. I have seen my dad several times at my mother’s house and normally that do not happen that many times. My parents are divorced, but they still do have good contact. I first thought that there was something with my father’s health. My farther works a lot and his days used to exist of sleep, travel to work, work, travel back, cook and sleep. I do not think that he is living a very healthy life and he also looks very tired sometimes. So, I thought that maybe there was something going on with him. But apparently it was not my dad who was not feeling well, but my mom. I did not really expect this, but I do not spend a lot of time at home and my mother is doing a good job at hiding her feelings. So, now I know at least from who I have this.
My parents did not tell me that much about what was going on, they only told me that my mom was not going good at this moment and that we should take that into account. Then suddenly, things got really bad. My mom has very heavy medicines and I do not want to be hard, but she is becoming now a bid paranoia sometimes. I do not know very well how to deal with these kind of situations and I rather avoid them, but I know I can’t. I had that feeling as well when my grand father died and my mother’s boyfriend died. But I try to live my life just like always and of course I will help my mother where I can. </p>

<p> This week I also was not very motivated to do things. In the beginning of this period I did a coding course, watched many interesting videos and read a lot. Since a week or so I don’t do it that much anymore. I try to get into that mood again, but I do not know why but at this moment it’s a bit harder. I started working more, so I know that I have to work less and I am looking for another course to start following now. I want to learn more about the American history or American politics. Actually, there are so many things I want to start learning and it’s hard to choose where I should start with.
My boyfriend and I, also decided this week that we are not going anymore to Indonesia this summer. Which I think is really really really sad, but it is what it is. Even though, we may will be allowed to travel again this summer it just don’t feel right to go there. But I feel so sad for the people living their who are totally dependent on people like us. They need us more now than anytime, but we decided that our health is the most important, so that is why we have decide to go at a later moment. I am just happy that we are still healthy and alive. Next week I was supposed to go to Ibiza, but also that got cancelled, unfortunately. Travel gives me really good and positive energy, so as soon it will be safe again to travel and the world is doing better I will go somewhere, but for now I should go on and make the best of it. There are also things to discover closer to my own living place. My boyfriend just bought a boat, so we can spend days at the water this summer, what I really like. </p>

<p> Together with Yasmin I  have been brainstorming about business ideas. I have been thinking about a kind platform where people from all over the world can meet. People who like to discover the world by meeting people from other places and by travelling. Especially people who are living in poor countries. I think writing about all things now gives me more motivation again, so that’s nice. </p>

<p> School related this week, we are still doing very well on the project I think. It’s just a bit different now than we were used to. But so far, it’s working out very well and everyone in our team is motivated and willing to work on the project. Since we are working online and things are working out well so far it quite hard to write feedback for my peers. I just cannot really come up with criticism or tips at this moment. Maybe it is just too early or things are just working out perfectly. I spend a lot of time making exercises on my accounting lab. This takes a lot of my time, but I do it because I think it is important. I do not necessarily like it, at least not all the subjects, but some I do like. Also, working with Excel is working out quite well. I watched the videos, which were really helpful and now I do understand it a lot better. Normally, I would choose for using pages or another program instead for excel or word, but I understand why we need to make use of Excel and it helps to give us a good overview of the company’s and their performances. </p>

    <h1 class="justheaders"> Learning Journal Week 4 </h1>
    <p> This week I was supposed to be on Ibiza. It was especially sad not being there when I was watching the new Netflix series White Lines. This new series was filmed on Ibiza and Formentera. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that I am still feeling healthy and that we are allowed to leave our houses. I will now just dream about travelling again and looking for new destinations to discover when travelling is possible again. </p>
    <p> My life is getting a bit boring now, I do pretty much the same things every day and every week. So, there is not much to tell about this week. I had only one day of school and the other days I took some rest and I did not really do anything. The only school related thing I have done this week is a lot of Spanish. I felt that I should more time on learning Spanish if I really want to do something with it, so I started with studying the semester one book again. I am not sure why, but always when I want to start with something again or after a long time or if it feels that I have forgotten about a lot of things I just start again from scratch. I don’t think this is always the best thing to do, especially since it takes a lot of time to start with things over and over. But I think this time it was better, because I feel like I totally get it again. If I look back to it, I think that a lot was still in my mind, but I just had to repeat it again. So for now, I have decided that I want to practice Spanish everyday for about 30 minutes. I want to do something so I can also practice with speaking Spanish more, I am thinking about looking for someone who I can help with something so that he or she can help me with practicing Spanish. I think the Spanish language is a nice one, what let me thought about maybe doing my internship or minor in a Spanish speaking country. </p>

    <p> I am also thinking about ways to make my life a living and fun life again, just by doing new and different thing. My boyfriend bought a new boat last week, so I was a really exited to sail (varen) for the first time. On Thursday the weather was great and we both had a day of, just the like almost everyone else in the Netherlands, so we decided to sail in the end of the afternoon. It was quite a challenge to get the boat in the water and everything, but it was a really nice day. We ordered food at a restaurant, placed the boat in the sun and ate our food while watching the sun going order. This moment let me realise that nice things can be done everywhere and that it is not necessarily to cross the bothers for discovering and doing new things. I also thought about why I really want to live abroad and want to travel and what I want to do when I live abroad. A lot of questions concerning the future, but then I realised that I should enjoy the moment. </p>

    <p> So, DBE related, everything is still going well. We are all still doing the things we should do and I think we will bring this project to a good ending. It is really nice to be in a group where you can trust the others and the process. I think that I am still considered as being a leader, even though I do not really feel like a leader, but I understand what they mean. It’s more about that during meetings I am really straight to the point. So when we are talking for a while about other things, I am referring back to the project. I know that I can rely on the others and I do trust the process. I think it comes kind of naturally from me, since this group do not really need a leader. But I think that it is important that there is one person who does the talking part to teachers, or at least the most important things we did during the week. I used to write the logbook in all the other projects we have had this year, this is the first project that someone else is doing this, which feels kind of weird to me because I was so used to write every Sunday about what we have done each week. However, I really do trust the other’s, so I am sure that everything will be alright in the end. </p>

    <p> I am curious about the Being International Day next week, especially about the guests. A while ago I applied for a vacation for the IStaff and I was supposed to be one of the new IStaff members, but I did not hear anything for a long time, so I sent an e-mail and apparently everything has changed because of the corona virus. For me this means that I have to write a new motivation letter and apply for a second time, but I think I will do this. I found some functions that I think really fits my interests and capabilities. It will be a good way to expand my knowledge and skills on organising and I think that it looks good on my CV. Besides this, I also like the part of meeting new people and working in a multicultural team with other motivated people.  </p>

    <section> <h1 class="justheaders"> Learning Journal Week 5 </h1>
      <p> Another week has flying by. This week I have been very busy with school stuff. For DBE we worked on the Due Diligence model and we have almost finished it now.
        The team work is still going great and I am still glad that I am a member of this group. I spent a lot of my time on working on my portfolio website. Since I do not know all the HTML codes I have to look for it and this takes time.
        The website is almost finished now and I am very satisfied with the outcome. However, I am a perfectionist, so in my eyes there are a lot of things that could have been better, but that will be for my second project.
        It was another learning experience for me. During this year I also learned that sometimes things can just not be as perfect as you want it to be, but that you should just be happy with how it is. And I am happy now. </p>

        <p> The Being International Day has been very interesting and I was especially impressed by Taiye Selasi. She gave a great speech and made a huge impact on me. My reflection about this day can be read under the name of learning outcome 2.
          I also had to make the Cambridge exams this week and I was kind of nervous for this because I was afraid that I would find it very difficult. During my highschool exams I really encountered issues with the gap-filling assignments.
          I practised these kind of assignments by making trial exams and I think it helped. After the exam I felt relieved and I was thinking about where I have been so worried about. This exam made me aware of the fact that my English really has improved.
          I really hope to even more improve it during the second year. I also had an interview for the assistant planner vacacy from the I-Staff. I think the interview went really well and that I made a good impression.
          Hopefully, I will be the chosen one. </p>
