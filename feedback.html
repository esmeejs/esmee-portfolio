    <p> In the third week of this module we gave each other feedback. I experienced this a quite difficult because of two things.
      Firstly, we are doing really well and everyone is doing such a great job that I did not really know what tips I could give the others. But, I think we were all coping with this, because I barely received any tips. And, secondly,
      since we are only working online I feel we are really focued on the output. Normally when we would be at school someone can be too late, distracted or not very motivated.
      Those things can happen online as well, but I really think that working online motivates us even more to give a great ending to this project. It was also only the third week, so I think it was also too early to give really appropiate feedback.
      This is the feedback I received from my team in the third week: </p>

      <p>
        <UL STYLE="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0em;">
      <LI> Spencer: 'I only have positive feedback for you…
You’re very dedicated when it comes to completing work for this project and your willingness to create files like Excel is a huge help to everyone. The way you communicate within the team, taking over some roles while also letting others guide the way, that’s a very good trait to have.' </LI>
      <LI> Mark: 'I am really happy to work with you again on this new project. You have a great working spirit and you are a very important asset to our team. You always deliver your work on time and finish the work down to the last detail.
After thinking of constructive criticism, I could give you I couldn’t think of anything, so keep doing what you’re doing!
Overall, I am happy to be in your team again, you are a hard worker and provide good company during the meetings. And don’t forget, you don’t have to carry the whole project on your shoulders this module, we work as a team!' </LI>
      <LI> Alisa: 'I can really say that I am happy to work with you on this project. I can see how structured and hardworking you are. It’s also nice to see how you took the lead, I think you act fair. You’re doing a good job. You really give your best for this project. You are very open-minded and you listen to other opinions. The only thing that I can add that you could put less pressure on yourself and trust the process.'  </LI>
      <LI> Madara: 'I am very happy to work with you, specially because I was intrigued to see how we would work together in bigger group. Andrea mentioned that we tend to deliver similar work, even though we have different personalities. You are very communicative and extremely hard working. I have absorbed that in this group you are definitely our leader, although we are all pretty equal. I would suggest to own up your leadership skills more because I believe that you have the best organizational skills among us. However, I am more than happy with your work and believe that you only bring positive aspects to our group.' </LI>
      </UL> </p>

      <p> I really do appreciate the feedback I received from my team. I am very glad that they see me as a fair leader and not just as a dictating leader. I really try not being a leader this time, but
        I think that I have this role just naturally in me. For me it is really important to the others and take decisions together as a team. I know that I have a team where I can rely on and I do trust the process,
        however I can understand that it could seem for other people that I am stressed sometimes or not trusting the process. I think this is mainly because I put a lot of effort in it, probably a bit more than the others, but I always give 200%.
        But, if I compare working in this group to working in the previous groups I think I have done a good job in being less stressed and trusting the process more. I already learned that quite a bit during module 2, when I was also part of a very motivated team.
        In this team I am learning as well about how to trust the process. It is nice to see improvement, but on the other hand I think it is very much depending on the kind of team you are in. For example last module, I was in a totally different team and it gave me a lot more stress than working in this team.
        I am a very motivated person and I can work the best with people who are also very motivated and willing to get the job done. </p>

        <p> I will see what I will do with my leading skills, but for this project I do not think that only one leader is really necessary.
          I have applied for an I-Staff vacancy and during the interview they asked me if I would like it to get more responsibilities after a while.
          Maybe I can use my leading skills for this, but I will just first start with the vacancy I applied for and see how it all works before applying for a leading role. </p>

          <p> We as a team also filled out the feedback poster. This poster is about the feedback we give ourselves as a team and how everyone thinks about our group performances.
            I think we are all glad that we are together in one team. We all agree that we are a motivated team. We are having a fair group process, because we are listening to each other and giving everyone the chance to give an opinion.
            We are working very efficient because of the good communication and weekly meetings. I am very curious about what our final prototype and report will be. </p>
