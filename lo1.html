    <p> The first learning outcome of this module is about managing information as a digital citizen. For this DBE
      project we had to use Excel. I had not really worked with Excel before, so that was the first thing I have learned during this module.
      Usually I am also more an Apple person than a Windows or Microsoft person, so I prefer to use Numbers instead of Excel. However, for this module we decide as a group to use Excel, since we all do have access to this program.
    </p>

    <p> So, the program we are using for the DBE project is Excel. I think Excel is a very useful programe for financial information,
      because it has a lot of in-build formulas. The functionalities I have used so far in Excel are for example sum, average, hide, merge cells and currency's.
      We all focused on one company. The company I have focused on is Brand Architekts Group. I made for every company a sheet and a general one where we could put the ratio numbers in.
      In order to come up with the right numbers for the ratios I copy pasted relevant numbers of the balance sheets from 2019, 2018, 2017 and some numbers from 2016.
      I also made us another sheet in Excel with all the formulas in there so we were sure that we were all using the same formulas to come up with every ratio.
      I then used the functions in Excel to calculate the ratios with the formulas we had already found. This was very easy to do because I could just click on the cells I needed and what they should do (e.g. sum or divide).
      After for example calculating the current ratio for 2017 I could just give 2018 and 2019 the same formula. After calculating my own ratios I copy pasted them to our general sheet, so we have a good overview of all the ratios.
      In the general sheet I calculated the average of each ratio by using the average function. This was really easy and I could apply this to all the other cells in the same column.
      We have merged cells in order to make sure that all our numbers and texts are visible. Then we used the 'hide' function to hide the row's and sheets that we are not longer needed, but still could come in handy in the end.
      The picture in the right column shows how I used the average function in Excel.

      <p> We chose to use Excel because we were more or less told to do so. An alternative program could have been Numbers, but this is an program for Apple devices and not everyone has an Apple device.
      In addition Excel is also great to use because everyone can work in the document at the same time and it is saved online.
    I made for us a kind of template so the only thing we all had to do was adding the numbers and applying the formulas.
  I was not really able to use it right away from the beginning because I first had to learn some more basic things about Excel.
So, that is what I did. I watched the two videos recommend in the finance lecture and I think they have been very helpful.
It was mainly the basic stuff but I learned for example how to merge cells, how to select cells, how to use formulas, how to hide rows/columns, how to apply the same formula for multiple cells and how to work with different worksheets.
I think working in Excel went pretty well. It took some time, but it looks good now. During the project I encoutered an issue when using the average formula.
In the cell appeared '####' instead of the outcome of the formula. I used google to find a solution for this and it seems that this was a lot easier than I thought.
I only had to make the column bigger and it worked.  </p>
<p> I think that I am very happy about how our due diligence model looks likes in Excel. I think the structure is good and it is easy to read the important figures.
  I have spent the most time on making the template and after this it was just about filling in the numbers and apply the right formulas.
  I think it is good that we have made a seperate sheet with the formulas, so we know for sure that we are all using the same formulas.
  Something that could have been better is that when someone changed a cell not the whole excel sheet got messed up. This has occured one time
  and it takes quite some time to fix it and make it nice again. I think this happened because we were all working at the same time in the document and we were trying to adjust the same cell.
  At that moment we decided that we would leave it for then and that only one person would try to fix everything to prevent something like this happening again.
  So, I think Excel is a really helpful program for this project, it is easy to use and also helpful that we can all work in the same document, because this saves time in the end.
  On the other hand, it is important to communicate to prevent such things as worksheets getting messed up because everyone is working in the same cell. Our final Due Diligence Model can be seen down here. </p>
