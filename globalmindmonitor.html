  <p> In the beginning of this study year I participated in the Global Mind Monitor.
    These measures things like my multicultural personality, muliticultural intelligence and my language proficiency. I participated in May again and these charts show my development in the different aspects measured.

  <div class="col-4"> <p> My flexibility has really improved during this year. I am aware of this and if I look back to the beginning of this year I now see that I was not very flexible.
    Back then I thought I was, but I definitely was not flexible. I saw it even as an issue that we were not informed yet about something that took place days later. I have never been very flexibile in my life, especially with friends, family and relationships.
    At school I find it easier to adapt to other people, but in my private time not really. Maybe it has to do with control or just the fact that I thought that my ideas or solutions were better. I think it is mainly about me who wants to have control of every situation.
    But during this year I learned that I cannot change everything. I can only change my own things and sometimes I just need to let my control feelings go. This is really important.
    I think I learned to be more flexible because of working in groups, being at school and having a relationship. Especially the last thing learned me to be more flexible. My boyfriend is very flexible, but I was not.
    He would also appreciated it if I would become more flexible and I think I am more flexible now than then. I try to let things go that are not important to me or things I could not change or influence by myself.
    It is just a waste of my own time. I try to make the best of things that I can influence and I try to do this by just focusing on myself and my own life only.
    By this I mean that I will not worry about things that I cannot change or influence. I will of course listen to other people and their opinions. And if necessary adapt to other people their wishes, because that is where flexibility is about. </p>
</div>

  <div class= "col-4"> <p> My openmindedness score decreased from a 6.5 to a 6.17. This has not really changed.
    My attitute is open and I am always in to learn new people and new things. For DBE this mean that I always listen carefully to what the others have to say because it could be a great idea.
    I respect everyone's opinion and I think it is important that everyone do have an own opinion. I respect each and every culture and I love to learn about new cultures.
    During this study year I have been the most impressed about the Moroccan culture. I had a great time in Morocco. The Moroccan food is amazing and I loved it to try new food.
    Also the people made a great impression on me. The host family where we stayed for two nights were really sweet and they really wanted it to great for us.
    They definitely put us on the first place and theirselves on the second, what is really kind of them. I really like it to discover new places and learn about new things and this trip really learned me a lot of new things.
    I think the most important thing I learned during this trip is that I should be happy with the things I have and be grateful for all the amazing things I can do in my life.
    I was aware of this already, but after Morocco even more. </p> </div>

  <p> My cultural-specific knowlegde has got better as well. This is because during this year I learned more about new cultures and people from different cultures.
    I have learned especially about business related topics during the BT lectures of Maria Angeles. I think it is really interesting to learn about new cultures and to learn about the do's and don'ts.
    I also learned more about the Swedish culture since we had an assignment last module where we had to research a culture involved in our supply chain.
    Swedish people for example really enjoy there spare time and this is something really important for them. I did not know this. So, I am learning new things about cultures
    through lectures, by doing research related to DBE and BT and because we have so many different nationalities at our school. Yasmin, one of my friends is from Germany, but originally from Algeria.
    I facetime with her at least every month and then we update each other about our lives. She learns me things about her culture and her life in Germany and I tell her about my life.
    We are different, but we have a lot of things in common. I think it is really important to have a proper understanding of different cultures. It is important when doing business, but also for me if I want to move to another country.
    In order to adapt, I have to know about the culture I am going to live in. </p>

    <p> My ethnocentrism is really low, but for me that is great. It means that I can see things from different perspectives and postpone my judgement.
      I do not focus on my own culture only. I think every culture is good and has great things. If we all would live in the same culture life would be so boring and there would be nothing to discover or learn about.
       Every cultural has something that makes it their own and that is what I really like about different cultures. I accept other cultures how they are because everyone has the right to live their own life as he or she want it to be.
     </p>

     <p> Another thing that really has improved over the past months are my Spanish language skills. I have actively participated in the Spanish classes and also did a lot of things myself to improve my language skills.
       I really would like to speak Spanish fluently. I am also practising my language skills through DuoLingo. This program is more focused on the every day language and not really on the business language.
      I also want to learn the every day language because it would be nice that during my next trip to Spain I can communicate to people in restaurants, hotels or on the street. I want to improve it even more by
      starting learning the second year book already this summer and by having conversations with Spanish speaking people. My idea is to call with people from Spain and that I will help them with something and that they can help me with pronunciation.
      I have to figure out how I want to realise this, because I do not really know people from Spain besides Juan. I am a member of some Facebook groups with motivated people and people who are willing to help each other, so I am thinking about asking someone in this group.
      I also improved my English language. In the beginning I was uncertain and afraid that my English would not be good enough. But by speaking English all the time I have learned and improved it so fast. Last week we had the English Cambridge exams and first I was afraid that my English was not well enough.
      But this test made me really aware of how much my English has improved during this year. After the test I was relieved and happy to see my own progress. I want to improve it even more, but I think this is becoming a natural process. </p>

      <p> Overall, I am happy and satisfied about my results. My goal for next year is learning another new language.
        I also want to become more flexible, because I feel that I can improve this. I am really organised, what I think is nice and I want this to be the same, but I just think it is important that if something is different than I expected it to be, I can response in a more flexible way. </p>
